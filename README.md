## Performance Results
### (10x10)
Execution Time of C: 0.000000 msec

Execution Time of x86: 0.000000 msec

Time Difference: 0.000000 msec

### (100x100)
Execution Time of C: 0.457143 msec

Execution Time of x86: 0.028571 msec

Time Difference: 0.428571 msec

### (1000x1000)
Execution Time of C: 41.657143 msec

Execution Time of x86: 1.257143 msec

Time Difference: 40.400000 msec

### Short Analysis
During 10x10, the input was too low that the speed of the computation was negligible enough by the system, thus the 0.00 msec for both C and x86. However, the speed of x86 assembly is evidently faster than C if the input reaches 1 000 000 and above. This makes x86 more efficient if the dataset is huge.
